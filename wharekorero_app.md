# Whare Kōrero Kaitiakitanga License #

## What is Kaitiakitanga?
Kaitiaki is a Māori word without specific English translation, but its meaning is similar to the words guardian, protector, and custodian. In this context we protect the data in this repository and will provide access to the data as we deem fit through our tikanga (Māori customs and protocols).

While we recognize the importance of publicly acessible data, we're mindful that the majority of tangata whenua and other indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. As tangata whenua, our ability to grow, develop, and innovate has been stymied through colonization. We must protect our ability to grow as tangata whenua. By simply opening access to our data and knowledge, we further allow ourselves to be colonised digitally in the modern world.

The Kaitiakitanga License is a work in progress. It's a living license. It will evolve as we see fit. We hope to develop a license that is an international example for indigenous people's retention of mana over data and other intellectual property in a Western construct.

## Kaitiakitanga of Content ##

  1. All data in the Whare Kōrero is under the kaitiaki of the respective Iwi Radio Station that placed the data into the whare.
  2. Each Station may make data available for download as deemed suitable by the tikanga associated with that data.
  3. You may download data to your device via this app, but the Iwi Radio Station remains the kaitiaki for that content. By downloading the data to your device, unless you have kaitiki rights to the data (for example, the data may come from your whānau, hapu, or iwi, and you have rights to keep the data for your own use), you agree:
    a. not to extract the data from the app
    b. only access the data through the app

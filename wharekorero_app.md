# Whare Kōrero Kaitiakitanga License #

## What is Kaitiakitanga?
Kaitiaki is a Māori word without specific English translation, but its meaning is similar to the words guardian, protector, and custodian. In this context we protect the code in this repository and will provide access to the code as we deem fit through our tikanga (Māori customs and protocols).

While we recognize the importance of publicly acessible data, we're mindful that the majority of tangata whenua and other indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public. As tangata whenua, our ability to grow, develop, and innovate has been stymied through colonization. We must protect our ability to grow as tangata whenua. By simply opening access to our data and knowledge, we further allow ourselves to be colonised digitally in the modern world.

The Kaitiakitanga License is a work in progress. It's a living license. It will evolve as we see fit. We hope to develop a license that is an international example for indigenous people's retention of mana over data and other intellectual property in a Western construct.

## Kaitiakitanga of Content ##

  1. All content in the Whare Kōrero is under the kaitiaki of the respective Iwi Radio Station that placed the content into the whare.
  2. Each Station may make content available for download as deemed suitable by the kaitikitanga for that content.
  3. You may download content to your device via this app, but the Kaitikitanga remains with the Iwi Radio Station for that content. By downloading the content to your device, unless you have kaitiki rights to the content (for example, the content may come from your whānau, hapu, or iwi, and you have rights to keep the content for your own use), you agree:
    a. not to extract the content from the app
    b. only view the content through the app

# Papa Reo API Kaitiakitanga License #

## What is Kaitiakitanga?
Kaitiaki is a Māori word without specific English translation, but its meaning is similar to the words guardian, protector, and custodian.
In this context we protect the data, the models derived from the data, and the natural language processing tools created from the data and models.
You may be granted access to the Papa Reo API tools so long as your intentios align with Māori tikanga (customs and protocols) and values.

While we recognize the importance of publicly accessible tools and data, we're mindful that the majority of tangata whenua and other indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public goods.
As tangata whenua, our ability to grow, develop, and innovate has been stymied through colonization.
We must protect our ability to grow as tangata whenua.
By simply opening access to our tools, data and knowledge, we further allow ourselves to be colonised digitally in the modern world.

The Kaitiakitanga License is a work in progress. It's a living license. It will evolve as necessary to ensure a positive future for Māori and indigenous peoples.
We hope to develop a license that is an international example for indigenous people's retention of mana over data and other intellectual property in a Western construct.

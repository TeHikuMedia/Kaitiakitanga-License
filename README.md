# Kaitiakitanga-License
Repository for the development of the Kaitiakitanga License.

If you'd like to use or adapt this license, you must first reach out and have a k≈çrero (chat) with us.
You cannot take what is in this repo and use it for your own purposes without first reaching out to
Te Hiku Media, the creators of this license.

We will always make time to help indigenous and other underrepresented groups. 

If you are a corporate, government, or privileged person or organization we ask that
you consider giving a koha (gift) for our time.

Note it is unlikely that the Kaitiakitanga License can be applied within a non-indigenous context.

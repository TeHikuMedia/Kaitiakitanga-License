# Kaitiakitanga-License
Repository for the development of the Kaitiakitanga License.

You need permission from Te Reo Irirangi o Te Hiku o Te Ika (Te Hiku Media) if you would like to use or adapt this license.
You cannot take what is in this repo and use it for your own purposes without Te Hiku Media's permission.

We will always make time to help indigenous and other underrepresented groups.

If you are a corporate, government, or privileged person or organization we ask that you consider giving a koha (gift) for our time.

_Note: It is unlikely that the Kaitiakitanga License can be applied within a non-indigenous context._

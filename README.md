# Kaitiakitanga-License
Repository for the development of the Kaitiakitanga License

If you'd like to adapt this license or learn more, please reach out and have a k≈çrero with us. 

We will always make time to help indigenous and other underrepresented groups. 

If you are a corporate, government, or privileged person or organization we ask that
you consider giving a koha (gift) for our time.

Note that it's unlikely the Kaitiakitanga License can be applied within a non-indigenous context.

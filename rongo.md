# Rongo Kaitiakitanga License

## What is the Kaitiakitanga License?

Kaitiaki is a Māori word without specific English translation, but its meaning is similar to the words guardian, protector, and custodian. In this context, we protect the data and tools associated with the Rongo App using Māori values and protocols.

While we recognize the importance of publicly accessible tools and data, we're mindful that the majority of tangata whenua and other indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public goods. As tangata whenua, our ability to grow, develop, and innovate has been stymied through colonization. We must protect our ability to grow as tangata whenua. By simply opening access to our tools, data and knowledge, we further allow ourselves to be colonised digitally in the modern world.

The Kaitiakitanga License is a work in progress. It's a living license. It will evolve as necessary to ensure a positive future for indigenous peoples. We hope to develop a license that is an international example for indigenous people's retention of mana over data and other intellectual property in a Western construct.

## Kaitiakitanga of Data Processed

Rongo uses the Papa Reo API, which processes your data to enable features such as speech detection and pronunciation assessment. The Papa Reo API has its own [Kaitiakitanga License](https://github.com/TeHikuMedia/Kaitiakitanga-License/blob/tumu/papareo_api.md) which is upheld by Rongo. Rongo runs the Papa Reo API on device.

1. All recordings are collected and processed on device. We don’t collect any recordings or information about the recordings unless you explicitly share your recordings with us.
2. If you decide to share your recordings with us, you assign us as the kaitiaki of the data that you share. This includes the original recording as well as the metadata created from the recording when it was processed on your device. This metadata includes the scores that our model assigns to your recordings as well as your progress in the app.
